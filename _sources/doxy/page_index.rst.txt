ionEngine is a C++ 3D application engine that aims to provide the utility of a game engine without raising the level of abstraction at which developers work.

ionEngine is divided into a number of modules. Each module is a collection of classes, functions, and types which may be dependant on other modules and is typically contained within a single namespace. For more on modules, see the :ref:`Modules <doxid-modules>` page.
