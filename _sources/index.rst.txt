ionEngine
=========

Welcome to ionEngine's documentation!

Overview
--------

ionEngine is a C++ 3D application engine that aims to provide the utility of a game engine without raising the level of abstraction at which developers work.

ionEngine is divided into a number of modules. Each module is a collection of classes, functions, and
types which may be dependant on other modules and is typically contained within a single namespace. For more
on modules, see the `modules page <modules.html>`_.

Getting Started
---------------

ionEngine relies on a number of `dependencies <dependencies.html>`_.
For instructions on how to build and install, see the `installation page <installation.html>`_.
